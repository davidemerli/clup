\subsubsection{Flutter Mobile Application}
The application has been developed and tested only on Android, due to limitation in the available hardware.

To install the application we provide two .apk packages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RELEASE Version: A smaller package containing the prototype as it would be released in a production enviroenment, downloadable here
    \item DEBUG Version: A bigger package containing the debug version of the prototype, which is useful for checking potential error messages, full content of API calls, etc. Downloadable here
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flutter Web Application}
A release version of the web application has been deployed using Github Pages, and it is available at https://clup-mp.github.io, without the need to install anything.

We also provide a package containing all files to deploy the web application, downloadable here

To test locally the web application it is possible to setup a simple webserver, for example by using python:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    python3 -m http.server
\end{lstlisting}
Then opening a browser on http://localhost:8000
