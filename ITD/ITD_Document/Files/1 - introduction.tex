\subsection{Scope}
This document contains all information regarding the development and the testing of the CLup prototype application and system.

The ITD is a follow-up to the \textbf{RASD} (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document) and the \textbf{DD} (Design Document) which define in detail the system as a whole, all the planned features and the design choices.

\subsubsection{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access controller}: a subsystem that permits the entrance of customers into the store. It can be a device like a smart turnstile that reads customers tickets or just a person of the store staff manually scanning tickets.
    \item \textbf{Business account}: a CLup account that is destined to store managers or operators and therefore the 'business' side of CLup
    \item \textbf{In-Site ticket}: a ticket that is taken by a customer near the store. It can be both a virtual paperless ti an emitter near the store premises
    \item \textbf{Virtual ticket}: a ticket issued through the CLup application
    \item \textbf{Physical/Paper ticket}: a printed physical ticket, emitted by a printer near the store premises
    \item \textbf{Valid Ticket} (at time X): a ticket that has a code recognized by the CLup system and valid for the specified time
    \item \textbf{Time slot}: a time delta that is associated with a number of bookable tickets (which varies and is customizable from store to store)
    \item \textbf{People-Counting System}: a subsystem that permits the counting of the number of people inside the store. It can comprehend a device like a proximity sensor or a smart turnstile, or it can be a person of the store staff manually counting people.
    \item \textbf{Customer Application}: the CLup mobile application destined to customers that want to shop inside stores adopting CLup
    \item \textbf{Operator Application}: the CLup mobile application destined to store staff to monitor entrances and statistics
    \item \textbf{Store Main System}: the store main server that communicates directly with CLup servers. All store subsystems and smart devices should communicate with it through an Intranet
    \item \textbf{Geocoding API}: Geocoding converts addresses into geographic coordinates to be placed on a map. A Geocoding API allows the use of their services to permit translation between textual addresses and Latitude/Longitude coordinates
    \item \textbf{Map API}: An external services that provides operations of geographics maps and the download of map information, usually of the places in proximity of given geographics coordinates
    \item \textbf{Hashed Password}: When a password has been “hashed” it means it has been turned into a scrambled representation of itself. A user's password is taken and – using a key known to the site – the hash value is derived from the combination of both the password and the key, using a set algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Time to market}: is the length of time it takes from a product being conceived until its being available for sale.
    \item \textbf{Alpha Test}: a trial of machinery, software, or other products carried out by a developer before a product is made available for beta testing.
    \item \textbf{Beta Test}: a trial of machinery, software or other products in the final stages of development, carried out by a party unconnected with the development process.
    \item \textbf{DevOps}: is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
    \item \textbf{Quality Assessment}: is the data collection and analysis through which the degree of conformity to predetermined standards and criteria are exemplified.

\subsection{Document Structure}

\textbf{Chapter 1} explains the purpose of this document, summarizes the scope of the CLup project and the relation between this Design Document and the Requirement Analysis and Specifications Document.
Acronyms and Definitions used through the whole document are listed and explained.
It provides the history of the document revisions and this very description of all the chapters, together with the documents used as a reference.

\medskip

\textbf{Chapter 2} presents the system on various levels of detail. An high level view is provided to further frame CLup as a system composed of different software running on different platforms and devices. Component Diagrams illustrate all the components of the various subsystems. Every component is defined and described, exhibiting its role in the system and how it communicates with other internal or external components.

\medskip

\textbf{Chapter 3} shows the most meaningful interfaces of the CLup Application, giving a nice idea of what the final product will look like from a customer's perspective.

\medskip


\textbf{Chapter 4} associates every component described in section \ref{sect:architectural_design} with the Requirements they contribute to satisfy, as a direct reference for developers.

\medskip


\textbf{Chapter 5} is another direct reference for developers as it expresses how the developement process will be organized, how and in which order the components of the whole system are to constructed. The same is done with the testing: how it relates to the developement process, how component are tested, and which technologies are to be employed.

\medskip

\textbf{Chapter 6} shows the time spent from each member of the team for writing this document.
