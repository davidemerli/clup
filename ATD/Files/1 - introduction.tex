\subsection{Scope}
This document shows how the acceptance testing is performed on an implementation of CLup done by another group.

The acceptance testing performed on prototype is driven by the specifications, the design decisions and the implementation provided by the team in written form on the \textbf{RASD}, \textbf{DD}, and \textbf{ITD}.

The implementation on which this acceptance test is performed is the one made by Nicolò Sonnino and Luca Pirovano and can be found at \href{https://github.com/PiroX4256/SE2-Piemonti-Pirovano-Sonnino}{this Github repository}.

\subsection{Document Structure}
