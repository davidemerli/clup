\subsection{Backend}

The code is well structured and organized, and each software module has its own folder.
Javadoc is provided as documentation and covers the whole application.

The backend tests are well written and they cover most of the use cases.

\subsection{Frontend}

The frontend is also well organized and correctly divided in sub-packages.
Fewer documentation is provided with respect to the backend code. Taking in consideration that framework used is Flutter, the majority of the code is self-explanatory: it is only composed of trees of Widgets, which mainly compose the graphics of the application. The application logic is documented, and Dart's Doc comments standard (represented by '///') is respected.

Attempts to make the UI code look more slim (and reuse custom Widgets to avoid repeating code) were made.
