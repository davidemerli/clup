\subsection{Running the system}

The system was fully deployed and ready to test: we were able to install the mobile application by downloading it directly from the Google Play Store; the webapp was hosted at \href{https://clup.cf}{https://clup.cf} (though it was not listed in the ITD document)

The backend REST API was also deployed and was available at \href{https://clup.cf/api/}{https://clup.cf/api/}

We also installed succesfully the mobile application using the provided build files.

\subsection{Building the backend}

Following the section 5 of the ITD, we installed the requirements Java JDK 15 (open-jdk) and Maven.

After pulling the repository from Github we run the command
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fullflexible]
    $ mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
\end{lstlisting}
in the folder IT/Implementation/Backend. The build was successful.

    \caption{\label{fig:Booked_Ticket_State}Result of the mvn package command.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deploying the backend locally}
As stated in the chapter 6 of the ITD a mysql data source should be available to the application, in order to make it work.

We hosted locally a mysql instance in a docker container and configured the application.yaml accordingly.

In the same folder of the application jar file we ran
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fullflexible]
    $ java -jar clupapplication-1.1.jar -spring.config.location=application.yaml
\end{lstlisting}

Running this will start both the API service and the Web Application, on localhost.

\clearpage
By connecting with a web browser to the address localhost:8084 (the port is configurable in application.yaml), the CLup home page is displayed correctly. We tried to register an account, and that worked properly, testifing that the database was initialized succesfully.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/deploy.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:Booked_Ticket_State}Homepage of the site deployed locally}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Running tests}
Using instructions provided in chapter 5 we ran the tests.
The application.yaml was not found in the folder specified in the instructions. Copying the application.yaml file used in the deployment in the src/main/resources directory solves the issue (if the database used for testing is the
same used for the deployment).

After doing these steps running
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fullflexible]
    $ mvn test
\end{lstlisting}
produces the following output
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/test.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:Booked_Ticket_State}All tests passing}
\end{figure}
This means that all the test pass, as shown in the ITD.
