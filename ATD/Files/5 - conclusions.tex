The prototype behaves correctly on almost every tried test, and the found issues are not serious and would require only little work to be fixed.

The presented application is graphically very similar to the mockups shown in the documentation, so it was easy and not confusing comparing the two. This is valid for both the mobile application and the webapp.

The whole system is near to be production ready, beacuse it is very stable and offers a broad range of features to all the actors involved (starting from the customers
up to the Store Managers).
