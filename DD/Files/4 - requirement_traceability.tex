In this section each component is mapped with the requirement that it contributes to satisfy. Obviously this is not a one to one mapping but each requirement is satisfied from a combination of components and each component contributes to satisfy one or more requirement.

It is guaranteed that each requirement is covered by at least one component and, vice versa, each component contributes to the satisfaction of at least one requirement.
